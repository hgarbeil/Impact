	Changed the way we calculate the crater diameter
		initially, use npixels within rim trace -> convert to 
		diam in pixels then multiply by avg pixel size
		this craps out at high latitudes as we no longer have
		circular craters (stretched on image)

		now calculate by going from npixels to crater area in km^2
		then get the equivalent diameter
